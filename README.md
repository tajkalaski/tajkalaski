# Hi, I'm Tyson 🐱‍💻
I'm a junior developer primarly focusing on front-end and ~~soon-to-be~~ **recently graduated** bachelor in Web Development. On everyday basis I like to overdrink my coffee while playing with different technologies.

## What I'm up to currently?
- 🔭 I’m currently working on **a chart generator with D3.js and React**
- 🌱 I’m currently diving into **the world of React (even deeper) and Ruby on Rails (my sister made me do it)**
- 😄 I am: **:coffee: overcaffeinated, 👩🏻‍💻 looking for a challenge, 💪 not giving up on any problem**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **I will probably talk to you about my high content caffeine coffee and I will definitely introduce you to all of my cats**🐾
